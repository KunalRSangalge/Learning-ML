LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
LangChain simplifies every stage of the LLM application lifecycle:

Development: Build your applications using LangChain's open-source components and third-party integrations.
Use LangGraph to build stateful agents with first-class streaming and human-in-the-loop support.
Productionization: Use LangSmith to inspect, monitor and evaluate your applications, so that you can continuously optimize and deploy with confidence.
Deployment: Turn your LangGraph applications into production-ready APIs and Assistants with LangGraph Platform.



LangChain implements a standard interface for large language models and related
technologies, such as embedding models and vector stores, and integrates with
hundreds of providers. See the integrations page for
more.

noteThese docs focus on the Python LangChain library. Head here for docs on the JavaScript LangChain library.
Architecture‚Äã
The LangChain framework consists of multiple open-source libraries. Read more in the
Architecture page.

langchain-core: Base abstractions for chat models and other components.
Integration packages (e.g. langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic, etc.): Important integrations have been split into lightweight packages that are co-maintained by the LangChain team and the integration developers.
langchain: Chains, agents, and retrieval strategies that make up an application's cognitive architecture.
langchain-community: Third-party integrations that are community maintained.
langgraph: Orchestration framework for combining LangChain components into production-ready applications with persistence, streaming, and other key features. See LangGraph documentation.
